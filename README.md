## Write the Binary Search Tree steps for the array [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2].
### Example: root is x. To the right of root, find y. To the left of y, find z, and so on.
Root:7

## Example 1
[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort
Write down the steps of the given array according to the sorting type.

1- [22,27|16,2,18,6]  
2- [16,22,27|2,18,6]  
3- [2,16,22,27|18,6]  
4- [2,16,18,22,27|6]  
5- [2,6,16,18,22,27]

### 2.Write the Big-O notation.

O(n^2)

#### 3.Time Complexity: Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle, Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end, Best case: The number we are looking for is at the beginning.

Average case: O(n^2)  
Worst case: O(n^2)  
Best case: O(n)

#### 4.After sorting the array, in which case does the number 18 fall into? Write down.

It falls into the Average case because it is in step 4.

##### Example 2
Write the first 4 steps of the [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] array according to Insertion Sort.
```
1- [3,7|5,8,2,9,4,15,6]  
2- [3,5,7|8,2,9,4,15,6]  
3- [3,5,7,8|2,9,4,15,6]  
4- [2,3,5,7,8|9,4,15,6]
```
